            A topic I find interesting is <strong> video game development </strong> as there are so many intricate and complex parts in game development and it is always fascinating to me how they are able to both make the game and optimize it in a way to play smoothly. 
            The game that got me interested in video game development is my favorite game xenoblade chronicles as that game pushed the limits of the hardware of the wii to the max and there were many tricks and techniques they used to optimize the game and to make it run smoothly.
